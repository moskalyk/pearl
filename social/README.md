How do you break encryption, but use subtle cues from playing cards, abstract from the arcana of the tarots embedded into private keys? Upload harmony in playing set from story conjured via mnemonic

When documenting process, ensure there is a mapping of visual representiation from philosophy, and application to code concepts as a test. 

# unilead
Shamir secret implementation from pearl embeddings, or, private key mnemonic abstract set

# gorse
I am the furze gorse bush, and there is no mnth in which I do not reatain my blooms. I am needle-bearing evergreen. I am here to rmeive you that you, too, are evergreen and everlasting. I encourage you to be ever blooming, as well, sharing abundance and gifts with the wrold, I link the inner and the outer worlds with the promise of fullfillment and joy.
