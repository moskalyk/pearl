# quaterion db
rather than a db constructing into bkd tree format optimizing for time, compute memory operations as memetic operations, to construct as a matrix operation from a tensor crate to accomdate pearl hex mappings from utf codes, into symbols, streamed over a looping blocktime transaction at 12.6 seconds (or some time based to EVM based chain that updates svg logo from javascript package to UP profile as a preference differential)

point1(x,y), point2(x,y) -> Mapping to Line that oscilates. Prepare a function to take a degree simulation, and run a batch process to rotate around a an object, where the vector mapp change, outputs timely snapshots on blocks in a linear line, truncated to a database like ipfs

create a conditional ?: -> points as cells, into backup tx to ipfs to personal server, like a tensor clock on 2 oscillating points
